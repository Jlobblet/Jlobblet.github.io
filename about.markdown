I'm a programmer who likes data science, functional programming, and writing horrible code for fun.
My languages of choice are primarily F# and Python, but I'm also a big fan of C# and Rust.
I have a love-hate relationship with C.

Outside of programming I enjoy photography, fell walking, and video games.
